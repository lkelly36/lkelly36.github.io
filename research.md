# Current Project

### *'An automated data analytics platform for forensic testing'*

My PhD project will use forensic data such as hair samples in order to create a data analytics tool that can be used to accurately predict
whether a person has taken a specific drug or not. Currently, the outcome of substance use testing is determined by humans, where various 
factors are considered which lead to a decision. This procedure is of course subject to error and inconsistency. 

The purpose of my project will be to use machine learning techniques to create a decision making tool that can accurately determine the 
outcome, therefore taking away the risk of incorrect judgement, error or inconsistency. The outlook is that this tool will be so precise
that it can be used in the court of law, by judges, to aid with their final decision. 

One example of when this may be used is in the case of family law, where a parent may have been accused of drug taking and if true could 
potentially lose custody of their child. If the wrong decision is made in such cases the effects can be detrimental to the family as 
the parent may wrongly lose their child, and a child loses their parent. On the other hand a child could be left in danger with a parent
who is taking drugs but has been wrongly dismissed. The hope is that the tool I create can reduce or even eradicate these risks.
