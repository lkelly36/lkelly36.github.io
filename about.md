My name is Louise Kelly and I am a 23-year-old student from Liverpool. I have previously completed a bachelor's degree in Psychology at 
[University of Liverpool](https://liverpool.ac.uk), before attending [University of Manchester](https://manchester.ac.uk) in 2017 to study
a master's degree in Social Research Methods and Statistics. I have recently finished the master's course and began studying an integrated 
PhD in Data Analytics and Society, which is also at the [University of Manchester.](https://manchester.ac.uk)
