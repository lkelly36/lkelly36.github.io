### GEOG5995M Programming for Social Statistics Assignment 1, *University of Leeds*

As part of the core required modules for my integrated PhD, I took part in a one week course at University of Leeds called Programming for Social Scientists.
This module consisted of an introduction to Python programming, using GitHub and some Markdown. I have utilised these new skills for the creation of my website.

A requirement of the module was for me to build an agent based model which demonstrated the way in which agents interact with eachother. The model was not based on a real dataset,
however a map was produced which displayed the movement of the agents. Unfortunately I was unable to obtain a gif save of this animation as the package required 
was not working due to bugs.

### GEOG5995M Programming for Social Statistics Assignment 2 (Independent Project), *University of Leeds*

For the second part of the module assessment (as described above) I was required to create a piece of software using Python code. This could be anything we wanted so I decided to use a dataset I was familiar with and conduct linear and logistic regression as I was also familiar with these concepts.
