## About Me

I'm currently studying a PhD course in Data Analytics and Society at the [University of Manchester.](https://manchester.ac.uk) 

## Research Interests

My PhD project's working title is 'an automated platform for forensic data testing'. I aim to use machine learning to create a model that uses forensic data to accurately predict whether somebody is guilty or not guilty.

I have previously completed a master's dissertation which investigated predictors of adolescent alcohol, smoking and drug use behaviours in the UK. 

Prior to this I conducted research into drinking motives and personality traits in adults as predictors of binge drinking.
