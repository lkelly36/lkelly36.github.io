## About Me

My name is Louise Kelly and I am a 23-year-old student from a small town on the outskirts of Liverpool. I have previously completed a bachelor's degree in Psychology at [University of Liverpool](https://liverpool.ac.uk), before attending [University of Manchester](https://manchester.ac.uk)  in to study a master's degree in Social Research Methods and Statistics. I have recently finished the master's course and begun studying an integrated PhD in Data Analytics and Society at the [University of Manchester.](https://manchester.ac.uk)

## Research Interests

- My PhD project's working title is 'an automated data analytics platform for forensic testing'. I aim to use machine learning to create a model that uses forensic data to accurately predict whether somebody is guilty or not guilty.

- I have previously completed a master's dissertation which investigated predictors of adolescent alcohol, smoking and drug use behaviours in the UK. 

- Prior to this I conducted research into drinking motives and personality traits in adults as predictors of binge drinking.
