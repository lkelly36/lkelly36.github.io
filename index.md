My name is Louise Kelly and I am a 23-year-old student Liverpool. I have previously completed a bachelor's degree in Psychology at 
[University of Liverpool](https://liverpool.ac.uk), before attending [University of Manchester](https://manchester.ac.uk) in 2017 to study
a master's degree in Social Research Methods and Statistics. I have recently finished the master's course and began studying an integrated

## Research Interests

- My PhD project's working title is *'an automated data analytics platform for forensic testing'*. I aim to use machine learning to create a model that uses forensic data to accurately predict whether somebody is guilty or not guilty.

- I have previously completed a master's dissertation which investigated predictors of adolescent alcohol, smoking and drug use behaviours in the UK.
