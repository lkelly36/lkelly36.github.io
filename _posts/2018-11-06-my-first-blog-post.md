I'm currently in the process of building my GitHub pages website for the first time. I have been asked to do this for an assignment that 
was set by the University of Leeds. As I'm part of the Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT), I am required to 
attend courses at University of Leeds, Sheffield, Liverpool, and my home institution: Manchester. 

When I first started creating the website I was using a GitHub pre-installed theme. However, I decided I would like to try my hand at 
creating my website from scratch using HTML coding. I found a really useful [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) which is 
helping me along the way. My website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I'm using Markdown to author my blog posts. The main
purpose for this post was to simply test my blog and ensure it is working correctly, so here I go...
